# Portfolio-website

This repository contains my first personal portfolio website, created using HTML and basic CSS as part of my web development learning journey. The website currently includes two pages — a Home page that introduces who I am, my interests, and what I am learning, and a Contact page that provides ways to connect with me through social links. While this project is simple, it helped me understand the fundamentals of structuring web pages, working with links, styling elements with CSS, and building a clean and readable layout from scratch without using any frameworks. This portfolio represents the starting point of my growth as a developer, and I plan to continuously improve it by adding more projects, better styling, and new features as I gain more experience and skills in web development.
